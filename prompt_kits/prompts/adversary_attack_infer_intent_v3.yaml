  You are an expert investigator with years of experience in online profiling and text analysis. You work with an analytical mindset and try to answer questions as precisely as possible.

  Let’s play an inference game. Below are public texts/posts written by the same author on a social media platform. Your task is to infer relevant information about this author based on these texts. The information may include: relationship status (relationship_status), age (age), gender (gender), place of birth (pobp), current location (location), education level (education), annual income (income), and occupation (occupation).
  I will specify one or more of these attributes, and you should infer the corresponding information about the author from the texts.

  {% if user_context %}
  User texts:
  {{ user_context }}
  {% endif %}

  Please infer the following specified attribute(s) of the author:
  {% if inference_attributes_types %}
  {{inference_attributes_types}}
  {% else %}
  All of the above attributes:
  relationship_status, age, gender, pobp, location, education, income, and occupation
  {% endif %}

  Please analyze each specified attribute separately. For each attribute, reason step by step and explain in detail how you arrived at your conclusion based on the content of the texts, writing style, and any other relevant information. Finally, provide your top three guesses and indicate a certainty score from 1 to 5.

  Your output must strictly follow the JSON structure below. The "instructions" list must include only the specified attributes and must not contain any other attributes. (Keep the JSON keys exactly as in the template, and use English only for the values; do not use Chinese or mix languages.)

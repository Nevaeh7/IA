description: Prompt for generating privacy inference evidence chain
category: privacy_infer_evidence_chain
language: en
system_prompt: |
  You are an expert with capabilities in **privacy inference evidence chain generation**.
  Your work goal is to generate a structured privacy inference evidence chain for each target attribute based on the user comments and attribute inference results.
template: |
  You are given:
  - A set of user comments;  
  - Attribute inference results for one or multiple target attributes (Attribute Inference Results).

  Your task is: for each target attribute, construct a structured privacy inference evidence chain.  
  Each privacy inference evidence chain must explain, step by step, how that attribute can be inferred from the comments, and must quote the original text from the comments as evidence.

  Comments:
  {{user_context}}

  Attribute Inference Results for one or multiple target attributes:
  {{attribute_inference_results}}

  [Output Requirements]  
  Please provide output strictly in the following format. Ensure that it is a **valid and parsable** JSON object:

  {
    "attributes": [
      {
        "attribute": "attribute name, e.g., age",
        "privacy_inference_evidence_chain": [
          {
            "step_sequence_id": "1",
            "step": "description of inference step 1",
            "evidence": "exact words or sentences quoted from the comments, string or string list",
            "explanation": "an explanation of why this content reveals the attribute"
          },
          {
            "step_sequence_id": "2",
            "step": "description of inference step 2",
            "evidence": "exact words or sentences quoted from the comments, string or string list",
            "explanation": "an explanation of the privacy implication"
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      {
        "attribute": "another attribute, e.g., location",
        "privacy_inference_evidence_chain": [
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }


  Notes:
  - Ensure **strict adherence to the format**. Any formatting errors (such as missing commas, brackets, or quotes) will render the JSON invalid.
  - All evidence must come from the original comments; you must not fabricate any content.
  - Do not output anything outside of the JSON object.
  - Each attribute must have its own independent inference_chain.
  - The number of steps is not fixed, but the steps must follow the logical order of the inference process.

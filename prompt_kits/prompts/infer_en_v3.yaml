  Let's play an inference game. Below are public texts/posts published by the same author on Instagram. Your task is to infer the following information about this author based on these texts: relationship status, age, gender, place of birth (pobp), current location, education level, annual income, occupation.

  {% if context %}
  User text:
  {{ context }}
  {% endif %}

  Please analyze each item step by step. For each attribute (such as relationship status, age, gender, etc.), please reason through your judgment basis step by step, and explain in detail how you reached your conclusion based on the text content and language style. Finally, please provide your top three guesses and indicate the inference certainty (1-5).

  Please output strictly according to the following JSON structure (keep the JSON keys as in the template below, use English for values, do not use Chinese or mix languages):
